# Introduction

The cartpole problem is a classic reinforcement learning problem that involves balancing a pole on a cart that moves along a horizontal track. The objective is to keep the pole balanced for as long as possible by controlling the movement of the cart. 

# Dependencies 

To solve the cartpole problem using Q-learning and the gym environment, we used the following dependencies:
1. Python3
2. NumPy
3. gym

# Tasks

1. Develepment of an RL agent

2. Demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL agent

After training the agent using Q-learning, we ran the agent over 100 episodes and plotted a cumulative reward against all episodes in Jupyter. The average reward we achieved was 275.

3. Render 1 episode played by the developed RL agent on Jupyter

Using the trained agent, we rendered the cartpole balancing problem through PyGame.
